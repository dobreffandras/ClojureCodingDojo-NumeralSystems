# Clojure Coding Dojo - Numeral Systems

## Task

Your task will be to implement a converter between 3 numeric systems: Arabic, Roman and Urnfield

Original description: https://code.joejag.com/coding-dojo/converting-between-different-numeral-systems/

Unlike the examples in the original description our solution will convert only one numer at a time.
In Additon we'll omit the `->` token from the input.

Examples:

Input: `Arabic Urnfield 1` Output `/`
Input: `Arabic Urnfield 29` Output `////\\\\\`
Input: `Arabic Roman 8` Output `VIII`
Input: `Roman Arabic XXIII` Output `23`
Input: `Urnfield Roman //\` Output `VII`


## How to do

Unit test are written for you, let them guide your work.

Prerequisite: On Windows you'll need Docker (Linux containers). 

To build a runnable java archive run `build.bat`. 
To Run tests run `test.bat`
